            Starting on 20th September, Chloe Solvey will be completing the Toubkal  Trek in Morocco to raise funds for Crisis and the Simon Community. Chloe will  be climbing The Jebel Toubkal, reaching a height of 4167 metres - the highest  peak in the Atlas Mountains! We want to use Reboot as a force for good to  support her &amp; Crisi. Hear what she has to say about why this is so important to her: </p>

	      <strong><h3>Healthcare &amp; Homelessness - Have You Ever Thought  About it?</h3></strong>
	      <p><br>
	        Maybe you&rsquo;ve been in the situation where you or someone you know has  had ill health – hospital appointments, travelling to different places for  treatment and the emotional strain of dealing with ill health.<br>
	        Now imagine the same situation where you&rsquo;re homeless<br>
	        Many of us aren&rsquo;t aware of the work that Crisis do in supporting  people accessing healthcare whilst homeless: offering support to people in  need, helping to organise appointments where there is no home address, opening  medical centres where people can go for advice and treatment, supporting the  discharge process when leaving a hospital stay, the list goes on. My own personal experience has led me to be passionate about advocating for it – and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing the Morocco Trek in support of  Crisis. Crisis is the lifeline for a lot of people, and I&rsquo;d like to do my bit in helping them.</p>
