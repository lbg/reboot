          <p>At the heart of Reboot is our Hackathon, where 180 people will compete  to design a solution to one of three challenges.</p>
          <p>Competing teams will work together in teams of six and use the latest  technology to provide a solution to one of our hack challenges. Teams will have  access to the Azure Platform, provided by sponsors Microsoft.</p>
          <p>Teams will be shortlisted and assessed on several criteria, including  how well they have addressed the challenges and their use of technology.</p>

                <h3>Bridging the Digital Divide</h3>
                <h4>Front-line telephony colleagues help customers with less digital experience to self-serve using our apps and online services. 
                  How can we use technology to support them delivering this vital service?</h4>
                <p>Rather than serving customers, front line telephony colleagues are trying to support customers to self-serve digitally or in App.
                  Colleagues struggle to get customers to follow their direction accurately as they can't see what the customer is doing.
                  There are frequent changes and additions in the app making it hard for our colleague to keep up with or know about.
                  Colleague attrition rates in telephony are higher than other areas of the group, leading to limited knowledge build up and experience.
                  Currently there are limited tools available to be able to help colleagues with the above challenges.
                  Older and vulnerable customers particularly struggle to press the right button, enter information in the right place or navigate to the right page.</p>

                <h3>More Money in Customers' Pockets</h3>
                <h4>Create a market-leading banking app proposition that helps put more money in our customers’ pockets. The feature should not replicate any current services in the Lloyds Bank, Halifax or BoS apps.</h4>
                <p>For the More Money in Customers Pockets Proposition
To date we have two hero features live in the app...
1. Benefits Calculator - A tool which helps customers identify a range of Government benefits and grants they could be eligible for 
2. Bill Switching - A tool which helps customers find a better deal on their utility bills e.g. broadband and energy when they switch. 
Both features are housed within our More Money in Your Pocket hub but is also where our customers go to see the total 'value' they get from banking with us. The value initially is a £ aggregation of: PCA benefits from Club / Packaged Bank Accounts + Cashback received from everyday offers. </p>
                  
<h4>Challenge: How else can we 'put more money in customers pockets' what is the next winning feature as part of this proposition / how do you better connect the existing features?</h4>

                <h3>The ADHD Tax</h3>
                <h4>In the UK, 3-5% of people have ADHD which brings an average £1600 extra expense to access goods and services each year. How can we help reduce this 'ADHD tax' (time and money) and make life easier for those it affects?</h4>
                <p>Not all ADHD Taxes cost real money. There are plenty of symptoms of ADHD that can tax your mental/physical health, relationships, and many other parts of your life. There are so many ways someone might be paying the ADHD Tax, but here are a few examples from the ADHD community: long forms, e.g. Mich Ovens point about 60+ hours to complete form, late fees, impulse buying, paying more to eat out/order due to forgetting groceries, not feeling motivated to cook at home. 
Aligns with Group activity focused on neurodiversity, opportunity to link up with DEI teams. </p>
